# Assignment 2 Postmortem

## What's your name?

My name is Aurora Havens, my BF calls me blueberry XD

## How difficult was this assignment?

Not so difficult once I sat down and did it but I got stuck on assignment 3 because I had no idea how to hookup bootstrap and SASS. Lucky for me, Bootstrap
is well documented.


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?

I learned a little bit of bootstrap and how to google the crap out of it. I learned about SASS and how to get the css file
BUT was not sure how to install it. 


## How could this assignment be improved?

Teach us how to hook up bootstrap and the SASS css. This was the really confusing part. Some of the bootstrap requirements were also really confusing.

## Any other comments?
